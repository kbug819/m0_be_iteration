# Self Evaluation

# How might the `each` method be useful?
- The `each` method is useful because you can run calculations or populate responses on several different data entries or information saved in array, and these can be run all at the same time.*
# What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
- I would like to practice through some more challenges. I've enjoyed the challenges and push to put all the knowledge we've gained so far to use. I would like to learn more about methods as it seems that that is a powerful tool in running and gathering data. I will read through Ruby Docs to find other helpful methods that can be used in my coding.
# What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
- I felt like I understood this assignment pretty well and it came easily to me. I feel like I have enough knowledge now that I feel comfortable trying new codes and have found better ways to research and search for ansers online to find solutions. I have also learned that if a code is multi-step and I'm not certain I have the answer, to set up the part of the code I know, then add in the extra elements needed to get the correct answer. That way I know which portion of my code I need to work on/remedy as the main code is checked and accurate.*
